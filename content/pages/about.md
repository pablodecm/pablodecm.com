### About

I'm Pablo de Castro, 
a young scientific researcher based at Padua (*Padova* in Italian), 
born in [Santander (Spain)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander,_Spain)
and formally trained as a physicist at 
the [University of Cantabria](http://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx).
I'm interested in a wide range of scientific and technological
topics, some of them you might infer from the contents of this site.

I am a Physics PhD student at [UNIPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua) 
working as a Marie Curie ESR Fellow
at [INFN - Sezione di Padova](http://www.pd.infn.it/)
within the [AMVANewPhysics](https://amva4newphysics.wordpress.com/) network.
The focus of my current research is the development of statistical learning
techniques for Higgs boson measurements and related particle physics data analyses. 
I also collaborate in several data analysis which exploit data collected
by [CMS experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Muon_Solenoid) at
the [LHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider). 


I will write here about stuff that I find interesting or might
be useful for other people (or myself in the future).
Some articles might be technical, including
some computer code or assuming certain physics or 
mathematics knowledge, feel free to comment for
further explanations.
