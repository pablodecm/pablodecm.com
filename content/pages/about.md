### About

I'm Pablo de Castro,
a young scientific researcher, 
born in [Santander (Spain)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander,_Spain)
and formally trained as a physicist at 
the [University of Cantabria](http://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx)
and the [University of Padova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua).
I'm interested in a wide range of scientific and technological
topics, some of them you might infer from the contents of this site.

I have recently finished my PhD at
[UNIPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua), where I was 
working as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ESR Fellow
at the [INFN - Sezione di Padova](http://www.pd.infn.it/)
within the [AMVANewPhysics](https://amva4newphysics.wordpress.com/) ITN network.
The focus of my research was the development of statistical learning
techniques for Higgs boson measurements and related particle physics data
analyses. 
I have also collaborated in several data analysis which exploit data collected
by [CMS experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Muon_Solenoid) at
the [LHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider). 


I will write here about stuff that I find interesting or might
be useful for other people (or myself in the future).
Some articles might be technical, including
some computer code or assuming certain physics or 
mathematics knowledge, feel free to comment for
further explanations.
