### About

I'm Pablo de Castro, a **Data Scientist and Software Engineer**, born in
[Cantabria (Spain)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabria)
and **formally trained as a physicist and as a scientific researcher** at
the [University of Cantabria](http://web.unican.es/en/Pages/default.aspx) (BSc, MSc)
and the [University of Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Padua)
(PhD).

After I completed and defended my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/pablodecm/phd_thesis)
in 2019, focussed on the **development and application
of new machine learning techniques and data-analysis pipelines to increase the
discovery potential of the LHC experiments at CERN**, I decided to transition
to a role in industry.

I initially worked for a [medium-sized technological consultancy company](https://www.treelogic.com/en/index.html),
where I eventually led the **ideation, design and implementation of solutions
in the context of several data and machine learning projects** both
for commercial clients and European R&D projects.

During this very formative period I also started collaborating
part-time with a [small climate-tech start-up](https://reforestum.com/), until
2022, when I decided to take on full-time role in this start-up **leading and
coordinating the product and engineering efforts through a strategic pivot**.

At the moment, I am taking some time to **explore and experiment with a few
personal projects**, but I am open to **part-time consulting
and hearing about new opportunities** where we could collaborate.
